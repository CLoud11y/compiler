The design goal of this course is to implement a lexical analyzer and a grammar analyzer. 
The lexical analyzer receives a C-code as input and outputs a token sequence (including the line number, type, and string value of the token); 
The grammar analyzer takes the output of the lexical analyzer as input and constructs an abstract grammar tree based on the given grammar.
